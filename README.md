# Depression-in-Ethnic-Groups

In such a fast-paced modern world, depression is inevitable for many. For many years, several individuals experience long periods of low mood, energy, and self confidence, all of which are common in depression. As a result, depression severely lowers the overall happiness and productivity of people, which leaves a negative impact on society. Several factors can cause depression to be prevalent in people, including stress, grief, and genetics. We, however, intend to examine one such factor further: differences in depression based on ethnic groups in the US. Historically, select ethnic groups were belittled and dehumanized, and were overall treated poorly. Even during modern times, society still remains slightly biased against these groups. This leads to a domino effect: microaggressions subtly lead to poorer salary, police brutality, and more. So, we expect that these groups may face a greater amount of depression than others.
